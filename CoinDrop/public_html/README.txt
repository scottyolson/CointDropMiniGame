Wasn't able to get the high scores done but I feel like I got the rest pretty much.
Most of the requirements are self explanatory but for the randomness of when coins drop is found on
line 94 of the level js files is where the speed at which coins are dropped per level is dictated
Thanks.
P.S. Make sure the sound is on, I tried some sound effects when stuff is clicked
